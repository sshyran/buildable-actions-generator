# Buildable Action Generator

Action Templates are open-source functions that save developers hundreds of hours when integrating databases, apps and other complicated logic. They work natively with [Buildable Workflows](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows), which means you can build, test, deploy any integration using Templates in a matter of minutes.

## OpenAPI Generated Actions

### Getting Started

`> npm install`

`> npm run generate PLATFORM_NAME`

Replace `PLATFORM_NAME` with one of the platforms available under the `platforms` folder

See generated actions-generator in the `generated` folder :)

### Adding a new platform

- Create a new folder under `platforms` (you can copy over one of the existing ones)
- Edit the `getGeneratorInput` function with required data (See [schemas/generatorInput.json](schemas/generatorInput.json))
- To use a local spec instead of a remote one (e.g the remote needs updating), add it as `openapi.json` under the platform folder (see the `circleci` folder as an example)
